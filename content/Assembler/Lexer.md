> [!tip]+ Tip when writing the regex for the tokens
> - Begin by explicitly setting the same priority for every regex
> - When adding more regex with the same priority you'll be able to identify the conflicting regex
> - The for each conflicting regex you first try to solve the conflict by changing the regex or you set a different priority

> [!tip]+ Tip when optimizing the regex
> - create a big and representative `test.asm` file
> - when your satisfied with the token_stream generated by your lexer, store the output in a file `test.token_stream`
> - then when you are optimizing the regex run `cargo run > temp.token_strem` and run `diff test.token_stream temp.token_stream` to see the difference between the two versions
> - This can be further automated into integration test
